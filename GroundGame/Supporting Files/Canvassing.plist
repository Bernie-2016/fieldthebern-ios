			<string>Canvassing refers to door-to-door campaigning that opens up discussion with your neighbors about issues facing your community. In political terms, it involves encouraging people to talk about upcoming elections and getting them registered to vote.</string>
			<string>This is different from many other forms of volunteering because it allows room for meaningful discussion – that is, it provides voters the opportunity to openly voice their concerns and for you to respond in a helpful manner. It’s also a great way to meet others interested in campaigning and to build up a volunteer base!</string>

      <string>Canvassing is one of the most effective ways to perform outreach for Bernie Sanders. Face-to-face interactions are generally much more productive than conversations over the internet or on the telephone – it’s much harder to turn someone away in real life than it is to hang up on them!</string>
      <string>Talking face-to-face allows for an earnest exchange of ideas and an opportunity to connect with others on a personal level. People are much more willing to listen when the conversation involves and affects them directly, and are therefore more likely to respond positively to Bernie’s message.</string>

      <string>Here's a sample script you can use when starting a conversation. However, remember that canvassing is an opportunity to hold a natural conversation with another person. Try to spend more time listening to the people you reach than speaking over them. People will respond better to your message when you listen carefully.</string>
      <string>Canvasser: Hello, there! My name is ______, and this is my teammate, ______. We are grassroots activists who are committed to getting people registered to vote for the upcoming Presidential election. Are you registered to vote?</string>
      <string>If yes,
Canvasser: Excellent! Do you know who you want to vote for President? Have you heard of Bernie Sanders? He’s an independent senator from Vermont running for the Democratic nomination. Here's a flyer with some information on what he stands for and why.</string>
      <string>If no,
Canvasser: Alright! What issues are the most important to you in this upcoming election? What do you think the President should be focusing on? What does your ideal candidate look like?</string>
      <string>[The resident explains what issue(s) are important to him or her]</string>
      <string>Canvasser: Thanks for sharing! Have you heard of Bernie Sanders? Would you like to learn more about Bernie’s stance on [issue]? This website, FeelTheBern.org, has 51 different pages that explain Bernie’s policy positions on a variety of issues including the one you just mentioned!</string>
      <string>etc...</string>
      <string>[Listen carefully to how each resident responds to your questions]</string>
      <string>Canvasser: Thank you for your time! Please encourage your friends and family to register to vote your state’s primary elections by visiting VoteForBernie.org!</string>
      <string>Make sure to ask for information the campaign needs. What's their name? What's their party affiliation? How strongly do they feel about Bernie.</string>
      <string>Don't try too hard to convince people, and definitely don't get into an argument. You want to leave with a positive impression. If they ask you to leave, politely wish them a good day and mark that down.</string>
      <string>Practice this script with a friend! One person can be the canvasser and one person can be a resident. Make sure you don't stick too rigidly to the script or dominate the conversation. Instead, let it flow organically. Work in pairs and have each canvasser alternate speaking with the resident.</string>

    <array>
      <string>The most important thing is to speak to as many people as possible with the time that you have. This involves keeping conversations short and to-the-point!</string>
      <string>Always maintain a positive attitude and interact respectfully with others. It’s more important to leave a good impression than to insist that Bernie Sanders is the best candidate or prove that someone is wrong.</string>
      <string>Always use open body language, maintain eye contact, and speak confidently. People will listen more eagerly it you make an effort to connect with them on a personal level and care about what they are saying.</string>
      <string>Always ask people if they are willing to volunteer for Bernie. Collect as much contact information from these people as possible including their home address, phone number,  email address, zip code, interests, and skills.</string>
      <string>Never answer a question unless you know the answer. If you are unsure about how to respond to a question, say so! Then, later, you can research the answer and make sure to follow up with the person who asked it.</string>
      <string>Never start an argument with anyone you meet. Some people will simply refuse to engage in meaningful discussion. Instead of getting caught up or frustrated, simply thank them for their time and disengage.</string>
      <string>Never place any flyers or other materials in someone’s mailbox. Not only is this a federal offense, it’s a rude invasion of privacy. People will be much more inclined to support Bernie Sanders if you hold conversation with them.</string>
